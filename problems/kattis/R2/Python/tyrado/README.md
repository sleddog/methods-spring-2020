# Kattis problems
In this lab you will be using python which can be found here.
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-375/
once you load this up send the file to execute by running helloWorld.py.

I created a program that prints hello world but also what ever else you put in it.
https://open.kattis.com/problems/hello
This is the main one I did. 





I also did another problem in case this is not sufficient which was the r2.
https://open.kattis.com/problems/r2
In this one you take in two numbers and get out the mean. so you input S and R1 but you dont know what R2 is so i wrote a program that made it compute this S=(R1+R2)/2.
To do this I took R2=((S*2)-R1).
To do this I scanned in the values and then had them be within a range from -1000 - 1000.
Then I got in my values R2 and S and then did the math and returned them as 1 answer.
unfortunatly for some reason it will not allow me to add this one. But if you find this one to not meet the test you are wanting to do I will add it here.
It works much better when you open and run it with visual studio code.

When you download visual studio code make sure you also download all of the python packages to do that
There are bars on the side there is an extention tab look for them.
