psr is a simple program designed to find the GCD that is less than the square root of a large prime. As long as you have IDLE on your machine it should run fine.

I would recomend not running it however becasue it is extremely ineffecient and takes quite a while to find the solution. 

Also, i have no idea why I can't use the branch dzumpano-assignment2
